# Quantum Superposition

Quantum superposition is one of the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics. It states that a quantum system can exist in multiple states simultaneously until it is measured.

## Mathematical Description

In quantum mechanics, we can describe a quantum state |ψ⟩ as a superposition of basis states. For example, a qubit can be written as:

{{< katex display=true >}}
|\psi\rangle = \alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle
{{< /katex >}}

where α and β are complex numbers satisfying:

{{< katex display=true >}}
|\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1
{{< /katex >}}

## Physical Interpretation

When we measure this superposed state, we will find the system in either state |0⟩ with probability |α|² or state |1⟩ with probability |β|². This is known as the Born rule.

## Famous Example: Schrödinger's Cat

The most famous thought experiment illustrating quantum superposition is Schrödinger's cat, where a cat in a sealed box is simultaneously alive and dead until the box is opened (measurement is made). This can be represented as:

{{< katex display=true >}}
|\text{cat}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\text{alive}\rangle + |\text{dead}\rangle)
{{< /katex >}}

This example shows a superposition with equal probabilities (|α|² = |β|² = 1/2).
