# Quantum Entanglement

Quantum entanglement is a fascinating phenomenon where two or more particles become correlated in such a way that the quantum state of each particle cannot be described independently, even when separated by large distances.

## Mathematical Description

The simplest example of an entangled state is the Bell state, also known as an EPR pair. For two qubits, one of the Bell states can be written as:

{{< katex display=true >}}
|\Phi^+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|00\rangle + |11\rangle)
{{< /katex >}}

This state cannot be written as a product of individual qubit states, which is a key characteristic of entanglement.

## Physical Interpretation

When we measure one particle of an entangled pair:
- The state of the other particle is instantly determined
- This happens regardless of the distance between particles
- The measurement results are correlated, but we cannot use this for faster-than-light communication

## Famous Example: EPR Paradox

Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen (EPR) used entanglement to challenge quantum mechanics, suggesting it was incomplete. Consider two entangled particles in the state:

{{< katex display=true >}}
|\Psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\downarrow\rangle - |\downarrow\uparrow\rangle)
{{< /katex >}}

This is a "singlet state" where the spins of the particles are always opposite, demonstrating the "spooky action at a distance" that Einstein found troubling.
